STLSoft 1.9 Known Issues:
-------------------------

 * The safe string library compatibility is not done yet. This is planned to
   be fully complete with 1.10.

 * There are some problems with GCC 4+ in compiling the fixed array classes
   with the subscript operators.

 * The GCC atomic integer APIs are not yet used. This is planned for the
   future.

 * The documentation is still hopeless. This will be addressed in the
   release of 1.10.

STLSoft 1.9 Suspected Issues:
