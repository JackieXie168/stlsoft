STLSoft 1.9 Known Issues:
----------------------------

 * There are some problems with GCC 4.0 in compiling the fixed array classes
   with the subscript operators.

 * The GCC atomic integer APIs are not yet used. This is planned for the
   future.

 * The documentation is still hopeless. This will be addressed in the next
   few months.
