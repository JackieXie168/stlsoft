Changes for 1.9.1 beta 4 (31st January 2006)

There are a few minor directory changes, a few bug fixes, and several
new components.

Extended STL
============

Many of the additions in this beta pertain to concepts and components introduced
in my forthcoming book "Extended STL, Volume 1" (see http://extendedstl.com/), 
to be published by Addison-Wesley later this year. Obviously some of these are
without publicly accessible explanations at the moment, but as the book
publication draws near, some, at least, will receive publicly accessible
treatments. As for the rest, well you'll have to invest in "Extended STL". ;-)

Additions:
==========

+ stlsoft::charset_tokeniser (stlsoft/charset_tokeniser.hpp) - a "refinement" of
  stlsoft::string_tokeniser, making it easy to tokenise using charsets (a la
  strtok()) without the mess of using custom comparators with string_tokeniser
  (which can be something of a drag).

+ comstl::cloneable_cloning_policy (comstl/enumeration_policies.hpp) - a policy
  that enables comstl::enumerator_sequence to be used with enumerators that may,
  or may not, be cloneable.

+ winstl::listbox_const_iterator (winstl/listbox_const_iterator.hpp) - an
  iterator class that is used in the refactored versions of 
  winstl::listbox_sequence and winstl::combobox_sequence.

+ winstl::shell_delete() function suite

Changes:
========

~ stlsoft/tokeniser_functions.hpp => stlsoft/tokenising/tokeniser_functions.hpp

~ stlsoft::string_tokeniser (stlsoft/string_tokeniser.hpp)
   ~ now uses c_str_data() and c_str_len() shims, rather than c_str_ptr()
   + new skip_blank_tokens, that supercedes string_tokeniser_ignore_blanks
   - string_tokeniser_ignore_blanks deprecated
   ~ lots of general tidying up

~ comstl::enumerator_sequence now properly handles enumerators that may or may
  not be cloneable, by deferring a Clone() until the second time the sequence
  needs to be enumerated.

~ inetstl::basic_findfile_sequence - moved exception policy to third template
  parameter, rather than second.

~ winstl/listbox_sequence.hpp => winstl/controls/listbox_sequence.hpp

~ winstl/combobox_sequence.hpp => winstl/controls/combobox_sequence.hpp

~ winstl/shell_browse.hpp => winstl/shell/browse_for_folder.hpp. 
  winstl::shell_browse() => winstl::browse_for_folder()

Removals:
=========

- comstl::degenerate_cloning_policy

================================================================================

Changes for 1.9.1 beta 3 (20th January 2006)

There are a few minor directory changes, a few bug fixes, and quite a lot of
new components.

Extended STL
============

Many of the additions in this beta pertain to concepts and components introduced
in my forthcoming book "Extended STL, Volume 1" (see http://extendedstl.com/), 
to be published by Addison-Wesley later this year. Obviously some of these are
without publicly accessible explanations at the moment, but as the book
publication draws near, some, at least, will receive publicly accessible
treatments. As for the rest, well you'll have to invest in "Extended STL". ;-)

Additions:
==========

+ stlsoft/collections.hpp: contains new collection concept tags

+ stlsoft::external_iterator_invalidation
  (stlsoft/exceptions/external_iterator_invalidation.hpp): new exception class
  for representing iterator interruption by external agents

+ stlsoft::iteration_interruption 
  (stlsoft/exceptions/iteration_interruption.hpp): a new exception class that
  acts as the base for iterator interruption

+ stlsoft::adapted_iterator_traits (stlsoft/adapted_iterator_traits.hpp): an
  omniscient iterator adaptor class that can detect iterator category, 
  mutability, and element reference category (a new concept that is introduced
  in "Extended STL").

+ stlsoft::filter_iterator (stlsoft/filter_iterator.hpp): an
  iterator adaptor class that can be used to filter out elements based on a
  predicate.

+ stlsoft/transform_filter_iterator.hpp and 
  stlsoft/filter_transform_iterator.hpp: contains creator functions for
  mixing filter_iterator and transform_iterator iterator adaptors.

+ several new components for detecting standard library features, and assisting
  with handling iterator categories, in: 
    stlsoft\util\std\dinkumware_iterator_traits.hpp
    stlsoft\util\std\iterator_category_limiters.hpp
    stlsoft\util\std\stdio_overload_detectors.hpp

+ inetstl::basic_ftpdir_sequence (inetstl/ftpdir_sequence.hpp): a new collection
  class that provides a vector-like interface over the contents of an FTP server
  directory; implemented in terms of inetstl::basic_findfile_sequence

+ mfcstl::CString_cadaptor and mfcstl::CString_iadaptor 
  (mfcstl/cstring_adaptors.hpp): class and instance
  adaptors for CString, dragging it kicking and screaming into conformance with
  std::basic_string

+ rangelib::range_exception and rangelib::empty_range_exception
  (rangelib/exceptions.hpp): new exception classes used by RangeLib components

+ rangelib::filter_sequence (rangelib/filtered_sequence.hpp): a new creator
  function that returns an instance of range_lib::filtered_range specialised
  with a rangelib::sequence_range applied to the given STL sequence.

+ rangelib::iterator_range (rangelib/iterator_range.hpp): a new class that
  adapts a pair of iterators to the Range concept

+ winstl::child_window_sequence (winstl/child_window_sequence.hpp): a new class
  that presents an STL collection over the set of child windows of a given
  window.

Changes:
========

~ stlsoft::auto_buffer has the 2nd and 3rd template parameters reversed. The
  internal array size parameter is now 2nd, and the allocator parameter is now
  3rd. All STLSoft components are updated accordingly. Backwards compatibility
  is provided in the form of stlsoft::auto_buffer_old

~ stlsoft::proxy_ptr is renamed to stlsoft::ptr_proxy. The old form is available
  for backwards compatibility

~ winstl::window_peer_sequence is now implemented in terms of new 
  zorder_sequence_base, as discussed in the chapter "Travelling Back and Forth
  on the Z-Plane" from "Extended STL".

Removals:
=========

- mfcstl::cstring_veneer (mfcstl_cstring_veneer.h) is now deprecated, in favour
  of the new mfcstl::CString_cadaptor
  
Directory structure changes:
============================

~ stlsoft/filter_iterator.hpp => stlsoft/iterators/filter_iterator.hpp

~ stlsoft/member_traits.hpp => stlsoft/meta/member_traits.hpp

~ stlsoft/type_traits.hpp => stlsoft/meta/base_type_traits.hpp

~ stlsoft_array_proxy.h => stlsoft/array_proxy.hpp

~ stlsoft_container_base.h => stlsoft/obsolete/container_base.hpp

~ stlsoft_proxy_ptr.h => stlsoft/ptr_proxy.hpp
